### Why Environment Variables Are Important?

Lets think about the configuration data we use such as 3rd party API urls or any other specific parameters consisting of key-value pairs troughout our web applications. Assume that you have to change those key-value pairs whenever the environment of your application run changes. For example, an API url for a test environment must be different than the one on pilot or production environments. It would be really difficult and time-consuming to change all those values manually and release a new package every time we deploy to a new environment.

Considering that there may be dozens of different configuration data in large and enterprise applications, this could turn into a nightmare for a developer. Fortunately we have environment variables.

> The most important usage of environment variables is managing application configuration data dynamically according to your environment. So that they prevent manual changes and possible errors caused by these changes.

Today we will learn how to use environment variables in Vue.js applications with an example application. If you are in a rush you can click [here](https://github.com/mrgenco/envvar) to see the source code. Note that the Environment Variables concept is not limited to Vue.js. It is actually a common concept in JavaScript applications. Check [this](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules) repo for further details.

### Environment Variables In Vue.js Applications

You can specify env variables by placing the following files in your project root:

```sh
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified mode, ignored by git
```

An env variables file consists of key-value pairs like following example.

```sh
VUE_APP_API_URL=url
```

Note that only variables that start with `VUE_APP_` prefix will be parsed.

### Accessing Environment Variables in Client-side Code

You can access environment variables in your application code:

```js
console.log(process.env.VUE_APP_API_URL)
```

During the build process, `process.env.VUE_APP_API_URL` will be replaced by the corresponding value. In the case of VUE_APP_API_URL=url, it will be replaced by "url".

### Using Env Variables with Custom Build Scripts

Now we defined our env variables and we changed all hard coded variables in our application code for accessing these variables.
The next step is to create custom scripts in our **package.json** file so that we can load different environment variables automatically in our builds.

By default Vue CLI projects have 3 mode. These modes are activated using commands below.

- **development** is used by **vue-cli-service serve**
- **test** is used by **vue-cli-service test:unit**
- **production** is used by **vue-cli-service build** and **vue-cli-service test:e2e**

We can change the default mode that a command uses according to our needs.

For example, lets create `.env.development` , `.env.test` and `.env.production` files in our root directory.
After that, add below scripts into the **scripts** property that exists in the **package.json** file.

```sh
"scripts": {

    "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",

    "serve-test": "vue-cli-service serve --mode test",

    "build-test": "vue-cli-service build --mode test",

    "build-prod": "vue-cli-service build"
  }
```

We can now run these scripts for our builds. Each script has its explanation next to it.

- **serve** : **.env.development** serve with hot reload dev server using development env variables.

- **serve-test** : **.env.test** serve with hot reload dev server using test env variables.

- **build-test** : **.env.test** build and create deployable bundle in dist folder using test variables.

- **build-prod** : **.env.production** build and create deployable bundle in dist folder using production variables.

You can learn more about build modes and env. variables in Vue.js by refering [official docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html).
